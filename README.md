# Project-Euler

## Overview:

Project Euler is a great website for coding challenges. It takes various math questions and asks the user to solve them. While pen and paper could solve all of these eventually, leveraging a computer to do the work is really critical. The majority of these problems revolve around lots of computations. This is where the computer comes in. I'm going to take some time here to dig into the Project Euler challenges and explain my thought process behind why I'm solving the problem a certain way. Thanks for reading!
